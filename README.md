After starting the game instead of going to the harbor the character creator will start:

Suggestions:
- musician perk, sanity gain from using instruments
- Ill Omen, negative standing start
- option to instead of extra perk recruit lizardman
- Introvert perk. Gives 35 more sanity but lowers party limit by 2, gives only animals for starting recruits.
- Archeologist. Gives more items when scouring trough elephant graveyard.
- Slaver. Buy and sell slaves for a better price
- Damned. Volcanos, floods, and other disasters will be created every once in a while.
- Eldrich Echo, creates random tome page every so many turns.
- Mark of the gods, can loot statues without penalty to standing
